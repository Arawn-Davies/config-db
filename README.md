# config-db

**config-db** is developer first, JSON based configuration management database (CMDB).

## Principles

* **JSON Based** - Configuration is stored in JSON, with changes recorded as JSON patches that enables highly structured search.
* **SPAM Free** - Not all configuration data is useful, and overly verbose change histories are difficult to navigate.
* **GitOps Ready** - Configuration should be stored in Git, config-db enables the extraction of configuration out of Git repositories with branch/environment awareness.
* **Topology Aware** - Configuration can often have an inheritance or override hierarchy.

## Capabilities

* View and search change history in any dimension (node, zone, environment, application, technology)
* Compare and diff configuration across environments.
